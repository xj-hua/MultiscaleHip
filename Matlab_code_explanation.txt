Matlab code: To automatically determine the four bony landmarks (RASIS, LASIS, RPT and LPT) on the pelvis, establish the local pelvic coordinate system based on the bony landmarks, and to transform the FE model to aligh with the local pevlic coordinate system.
             RASIS: Right anterior superior iliac spines
             LASIS: Left anterior superior iliac spines
             RPT:   Right pubic tubercles
             LPT:   Left pubic tubercles
